# Real-Time VLM Webcam Captioning
## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision application that uses a Visual-Language Model (VLM) to generate descriptive text captions for a live webcam stream. The system employs aggressive frame-skipping and optimized data handling to run a large language model (BLIP) smoothly on a local machine, achieving near real-time scene understanding.

The **VLM** is designed to act as the "eyes" and "voice" of an intelligent agent (like a personal assistant robot), describing the environment and events as they occur.
